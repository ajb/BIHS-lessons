## Do-now

Suppose we have the following variables:

```js
var movies = ['The Avengers', 'Star Wars', 'Superman'];
var resultIndices = [0, 2];
```

Write a function called `printResults(movies, resultIndices)`. This function takes in two parameters: `resultIndices` represents an array of indices into the movies array of matched movies; `movies` is an array containing all movies. This function should return an array of strings. Each string should be a movie that matches the user's search query.

> Hint: use a `for` loop to iterate through `resultIndices`.
> Hint 2: look at your homework...


## Do-now review

- What are "indices"?
- What values do `[0, 2]` correspond to?




## Lecture

(Paper for notes)
- We're going to learn about Hashes
- Hashes are similar to Arrays in that they are a type of Data Structure (define)
- Arrays have order, hashes do not

- Example of array?
  - recipe
  - school schedule

- Example of hash:
  - names of students
  - grocery list


```js
var animalSounds = { "cow": "Moo", "cat": "Meow", "dog": "Woof" };
```

- Curly braces
- Three key-value pairs
  - key, value
  - separated by commas

- Keys: must be strings
- Values: can be any data type (string, boolean, number, hash, array)

## Access and print an element of a hash

```js
console.log(animalSounds["cat"]);
```

- What is the key?
- What is the value?
- What does it print?
- What if we wanted to access the sound that a dog makes?
- What if we wanted to access the value that corresponds to the cow key?

## Change the value of a key-value pair in a hash

```js
animalSounds["cat"] = "Purr";
console.log(animalSounds["cat"]);
```

## Add a key-value pair to the hash

```js
animalSounds["snake"] = "Hiss";
console.log(animalSounds["snake"]);
```

## Iterate

```js
for (key in animalSounds) 
{ 
  console.log("the key is: " + key + " and the value is: " + animalSounds[key]); 
}
```

## Remove key-value pair

```js
delete animalSounds["dog"];
```

# We do

```js
var worldCapitals = {"United States" : "Washington D.C.", "United Kingdom": "London", "China" : "Beijing", "Bangladesh" : "Dhaka"};
```

1. How do I print out China's capital?
2. How do I change the United States' capital?
3. How do I add one country-capital pair to the hash?
4. How do I remove Bangladesh's key-value pair?
5. How do I print each capital in our hash by using a loop?

# You do

Create a hash that has five key-value pairs. The hash can represent anything.

1. Print out each value without using a loop.
2. Change two of the values.
3. Add a key-value pair to your hash.
4. Remove a key-value pair from your hash (cannot be the one you added in step 3).
5. Print each key and value using a loop.

# Exit ticket

What does the following code output:

```js
var hashPetName = 
{
  dog: "Rex",
  cat: "Mistigri"
}

console.log("My dog's name is " + hashPetName["dog"] + " and my cat's name is " + hashPetName["cat"] );
```
