## Do now

```
function getRandomNumber(min, max) {
  return (Math.floor(Math.random() * (max + 1 - min)) + min);
}
```

Write this function:
  - Use the `getRandomNumber` function to Generate a random number between 1 and 10
  - Store this number in a variable called `randomNumber`
  - If `randomNumber` is either 9 or 10, log "carrots"
  - Otherwise, log "broccoli"


## HW Recap

Create this function:

```
// - Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (you can use the function from earlier)
// - As the user to guess *two* numbers
// - If either of their guesses match, then log "You win"
// - Otherwise, log "You lose"
```

- Volunteers present on the board
- We fix solution
- Are there multiple ways to solve this problem? Yes.

## I do

- Demo of calculator project

You are going to build the guts of a two-operand, integer calculator. 
You will be given some starter code. 
Your functions must be named the same and take in the same parameters.
Do not modify any of the other files.
Note that the "log" button is not natural log (base e) but log base 10.
The random number button should generate a number between 1 and 1000.
