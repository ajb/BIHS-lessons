## Do now (will be collected and graded)

1. Why makes Scratch different from other programming languages?
2. Explain what a "loop" is.

## Lecture

So on Monday we started learning about Scratch, which is going to teach us the basics of programming. We learned how to make Scratchy the cat move, and how to use loops to control the "flow" of our program. 

There's another core concept of computer programs called "variables". Can anyone tell me where the variable is in the following equation?

`2x + 5 = 9`

Variables in programming are similar to variables in math class: a variable is a _placeholder for a changing value_.

Let's write that definition down:

- Variable is a placeholder for a value
- A variable has a `name` and a `value`

## I do

Let's build a madlib. Does everyone know what a madlib is? (Draw on board)

> "My favorite food is (kind of food). You can get it at (name of store). 

We're going to make this madlib inside of Scratch.

(Create madlib without using variables)

Alright, so the madlib works. But did we use any variables? Let's create it again, but this time we'll use variables.

## We do

So let's all follow along as I create this program on the board. So we want to ask all of the questions at the beginning, store the answers in variables, and then say the madlib at the end. (Remove all existing blocks, wait for students to get Scratch open.)

- How do we ask a question?
- Now this is important: you need to create your variable in the "data" section. What should we call it?
- Which one of these blocks that were created should we use to set our variable to the answer?
- Now let's ask another question...
- Now let's say it

## You do

1. Create a program that calculates the `area` of a rectangle
2. Remember, you'll need to ask for the `height` and `width`
3. The function is `height * width = area`.

## Bonus

Use a conditional statement to display a certain message _only if_ the area is 20.

## Closing

Today we covered the basics of using variables when writing programs, of one of the core concepts of computer programming.
