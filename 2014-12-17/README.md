## Do now (will be collected and graded)

1. Why makes Scratch different from other programming languages?
2. Explain what a "loop" is.

## Lecture

So on Monday we started learning about Scratch, which is going to teach us the basics of programming. We learned how to make Scratchy the cat move, and how to use loops to control the "flow" of our program. 

There's another core concept of computer programs called "variables". Can anyone tell me where the variable is in the following equation?

`2x + 5 = 9`

Variables in programming are similar to variables in math class: a variable is a _placeholder for a changing value_.

Let's write that definition down:

- Variable is a placeholder for a value
- A variable has a `name` and a `value`

## I do

Let's build a madlib. Does everyone know what a madlib is? (Draw on board)

> "My favorite food is (kind of food). You can get it at (name of store), where it's really (adjective). 

We're going to make this madlib inside of Scratch.

(Create madlib without using variables)

Alright, so the madlib works. But did we use any variables? Let's create a new program, just a simple one that asks your name and says "Hello (name)", but this time we'll use variables.

## We do

## You do

1. Create a program that calculates the `area` of a rectangle
2. Remember, you'll need to ask for the `height` and `width`
3. The function is `height * width = area`.

## Bonus

Use a conditional statement to display a certain message _only if_ the area is 20.

## Closing

Today we covered the basics of using variables when writing programs, of one of the core concepts of computer programming.
