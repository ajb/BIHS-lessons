## Discussion

(Somehow fits into the info session?)

Alright, so before we start learning about programming, there's a question I want you to think about:

> Who is smarter, a human or a computer?

If there's time, break into groups and talk for a few minutes.

- Discuss the answer: computers are better at some things, but they can't think for themselves.
- This is something to remember when learning programming, you have to be very specific with computers.
  - Computers are faster than humans at doing math, calculations
  - Humans can think for themselves

## We do

- Put paper at back of room
- Ask student to pick up paper and put it at the front of the room
- I am robot, one student at a time, say your name, give one direction at a time

- What did we learn about how we talk to the robot?
  - Precise
  - This is also how we talk to computers when we write code

## Khan Academy Lesson

- Why do we have to write in a special language to talk to a computer?
- We're going to quickly learn a new language called ProcessingJS
  - That's right, we're going to learn a language in just one day.
  - ProcessingJS is a language for drawing with a computer
  - Is ProcessingJS the only language that we can use when speaking to computers?
    - No, there's lots. Just as many computer languages as human languages.

## We do

- Let's open up khanacademy.com/cs
  - Intro to JS
  - Challenge: Crazy Face
  - Click through the tour so it goes away

- This is our "text editor" on the left. This is where we write our code
- Let's change one of these numbers and see what happens


## You do

- See if you can create a new circle on the page
- Let's go back to the intro now, and on your own, you can watch the video, and work on the H to Hopper challenge

## Discussion

- So what kind of units are we working with?
  - pixels
- What is a "parameter" or an "argument"?
- What happens if I delete the parenthesis? Or the semi-colon? Or if I misspell the word ellipse?

## Wrap up

- What did we want to teach you with this lesson?

- What can you tell me about how we talk to computers?
  - Precise

- What happens if something doesn't work?
  - We could be misspelling something
  - We could have an error with our "syntax" -- semicolons, parens, etc.
  - REMEMBER, it's OK if something doesn't work the first time. Let's ask Manish -- have you ever forgotten the semicolon and had your code not work? This happens to me dozens of times EACH DAY, so it's totally normal if there's an error in your code and you have to fix it.

- We'll see you next week, where we'll start learning a new computer language.
