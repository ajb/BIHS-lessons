### Hackathon shareout

- Does anyone want to share what they did at the hackathon?
- Here's a game the 2nd year students at BIHS made: http://bit.ly/ninjaskittles
- Link to Manish/Kermen's team?
- There will be another one at the end of the year!

### Review

- Do you agree or disagree with the quote above?
- If you remember, we did an exercise on the first day of class... human + robot
- How do a human and a computer program work together?
  - Human can give input
- Do you ever team with a computer program?
  - We all have, when writing HTML/CSS
  
Why are we asking these questions? Because we're going to start learning about writing computer programs, which are a little different from the HTML & CSS we've been writing so far. We're going to be using a language called Scratch to introduce the concept of programming, but the real language we'll be learning is called JavaScript.

We've actually seen some JavaScript in our class before... does anyone remember where?

### Exercise

Everyone should log in to http://scratch.mit.edu/ and create an account. This should take a couple of minutes, and then I'll do a quick demo on the projector.

### Demo on board

So as you might have seen, Scratch is a kind of programming language. You get these blocks here, and you can drag them to the right side to build a program. Can someone tell me why this is kind of weird, compared to most programming languages?

- Programming languages are text-based, Scratch is _visual_. That's part of why it's really good for learning!

### We do

### You do

- Why would a developer prefer to use the program with the repeat block over the first program you create?
- What did we do to our CSS that was similar?

### Closing

- Submit your scratch program: http://bit.ly/BIHSProjectScriptEd
- Today we made our first program. Does anyone want to share how it went?
- Did anyone discover anything new in Scratch?
