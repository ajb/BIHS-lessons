## Do now

Reduce the following conditional statements into boolean (true / false) values:

1.

```js
var myAge = 40;
var result = myAge > 50 || myAge < 20
console.log(result); 
// What appears in the console?
```

2.

```js
var x = 10;
var result = x < 15 && x < 13 && x != 12 && 10 > 2;
console.log(result); 
// What appears in the console?
```

3.

```js
var favoriteColor = 'red';
var result = favoriteColor == 'purple' || favoriteColor == 'red' || favoriteColor == 'green';
console.log(result); 
// What appears in the console?
```

4.

```js
var myGuess = 15;
var result = (myGuess < 10 && myGuess > 14) || myGuess == 15;
console.log(result); 
// What appears in the console?
```

5.

```js
var myGuess = 15;
var result = myGuess < 10 && (myGuess > 14 || myGuess == 15);
console.log(result); 
// What appears in the console?
```

Questions:

- What does "reduce" mean?
- How do we reduce these?
- What if we change `myGuess` to "blah"? Or if we forget to set it? (Error)
- How do the parens affect the outcome in 4 and 5?

## Lecture

Let's play high low together as a class. I'm going to select a random number between 1 and 10 in my head. Your job is to guess the number. I can only say "too high", "too low", or "correct".

[Play game...]

- Now, we're going to implement this game in JavaScript.
- Starter code: http://jsbin.com/gudufa/2/edit
- Bonus: Make the random number be between 1-100 instead of 1-10.
- Bonus part two: change the status message to differentiate between guesses that are close, and those that are far:
  - "Too low, not even close!"
  - "Too low, but you're close!"
  - "Too high, not even close!"
  - "Too high, but you're close!"
