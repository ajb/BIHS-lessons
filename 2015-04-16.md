## Do now

Given the following array:

```js
var teachers = ['Adam', 'Joseph', 'Becca'];
```

1. What does `teachers.length` return?
2. What does `teachers[1]` return?
3. What does `teachers.push('Manish')` do?
4. What does `teachers.unshift('Manish')` do?

## Lecture

- We're going to talk about loops. 
- Loops are a tool that programmers can use to run the same code over and over again. 
- Arrays are often used in tandem with loops
- Our arrays will be a lot more useful once we know how to use loops

- What's an example of a loop in real life?

- Paid for a metrocard/bus with coins? 
  - After we deposit a coin, the machine counts the total $ we've deposited
  - It keeps counting until we've deposited enough money
  - Once we've deposited enough money, it tell us that we can stop depositing coins
    - This is called an EXIT CONDITION

- School is a loop!
- We go to class... and go to another class... and go to another class...
- Until school is over (exit condition)

### I'm going to show you what a `while` loop looks like:

```js
var i = 0;

if (i < 2)
{
  console.log(i);
  i = i + 1;
}

console.log("Done!");
```

- *Initialize* `i` to 0. 
- Check if i is less than 2.
  - This is EXIT CONDITION
- Log `i`, and increase `i` by one. (*increment*)
- Line 9 only runs once the loop as terminated.

Output:

```
0
1
Loop terminated.
```

- Step through code...

- What happens if we don't include the `i = i + 1`?
- Infinite loop! This means that the exit condition was never reached

### We do

- How do I write a while loop that prints "Justin Bieber" 10 times?
- How do I write a while loop that iterates 5 times and prints out the sequence 0 to 4?

### You do

- Write a while loop that prints "Lady GaGa" 15 times.
- Write a while loop that iterates 8 times and prints out the sequence 0 to 7.
- Bonus: write a while loop that guesses random numbers until the number 5 is guessed

(
remember our random number function: 

```
function getRandomNumber(min, max) {
  return (Math.floor(Math.random() * (max + 1 - min)) + min);
}
```
)

## Lecture

Now you're probably wondering how we can use arrays with our loops. To do that, we're going to create another kind of loop, called a `for` loop.

```js
for (var i=0; i<2; i=i+1)
{
  console.log(i);
}

console.log("Loop terminated");
```

This `for` loop does the same thing as our `while` loop from before, but the syntax is different. Because we're programmers and we like to do things with the least amount of effort as possible, we prefer to use for loops when we can.

- Suppose we want to print every number between 0 and 100. I could do this:

```js
console.log(0);
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
...
```

Or we could do this:

```js
for (var i=0; i<101; i=i+1)
{
  console.log(i);
}
```

- In four lines, we accomplished with a loop something that would have taken 101 lines without a loop!
- We initialize the variable, check the condition, and increment the variable all in one line.
- but we're still not using arrays!

To use an array with our loop:

```js

var fruits = ["banana", "watermelon", "apple"];

for (var i=0; i < fruits.length; i=i+1)
{
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}

console.log("Loop terminated");
```

- Walk through code

### We do

Let's write an array full of 7 vegetables. How do I write a for loop that prints out each vegetable?

### You do

- Convert your `while` loops into `for` loops
- Write an array of all of your classes at BIHS. Write a for loop that prints out each class, along with the order it comes in.


### Exit ticket

Explain what the code below outputs:

(change to `while` if necessary)

```js
var countries = ["China", "Bangladesh","Dominican Republic"];

for (var i=0; i<3; i++)
{
  if (i==0 || i==3)
  {
    alert(countries[i]);
  }
}
```
