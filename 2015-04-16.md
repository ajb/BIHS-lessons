## Do now

Given the following array:

```js
var teachers = ['Adam', 'Joseph', 'Becca'];
```

1. What does `teachers.length` return?
2. What does `teachers[1]` return?
3. What does `teachers.push('Manish')` do?
4. What does `teachers.unshift('Manish')` do?

## Lecture

- We're going to talk about loops. 
- Loops are a tool that programmers can use to run the same code over and over again. 
- Arrays are often used in tandem with loops
- Our arrays will be a lot more useful once we know how to use loops

- What's an example of a loop in real life?

- Paid for a metrocard/bus with coins? 
  - After we deposit a coin, the machine counts the total $ we've deposited
  - It keeps counting until we've deposited enough money
  - Once we've deposited enough money, it tell us that we can stop depositing coins
    - This is called an EXIT CONDITION

- School is a loop!
- We go to class... and go to another class... and go to another class...
- Until school is over (exit condition)

### I'm going to show you what a `while` loop looks like:

```js
var i = 0;

if (i < 2)
{
  console.log(i);
  i = i + 1;
}

console.log("Done!");
```

- *Initialize* `i` to 0. 
- Check if i is less than 2.
  - This is EXIT CONDITION
- Log `i`, and increase `i` by one. (*increment*)
- Line 9 only runs once the loop as terminated.

Output:

```
0
1
Loop terminated.
```

- Step through code...

- What happens if we don't include the `i = i + 1`?
- Infinite loop! This means that the exit condition was never reached

### We do

- How do I write a while loop that prints "Justin Bieber" 10 times?
- How do I write a while loop that iterates 5 times and prints out the sequence 0 to 4?

### You do

- Write a while loop that prints "Lady GaGa" 15 times.
- Write a while loop that iterates 8 times and prints out the sequence 0 to 7.
- Bonus: write a while loop that guesses random numbers until the number 5 is guessed

(
remember our random number function: 

```
function getRandomNumber(min, max) {
  return (Math.floor(Math.random() * (max + 1 - min)) + min);
}
```
)
